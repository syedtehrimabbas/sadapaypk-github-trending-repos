# sadapaypk-github-trending-repos
The goal of this assignment is to build a simple single screen app which shows the current trending Github repositories fetched from a public API. The design and business specifications have been provided below. We have deliberately kept the app simple enough for everyone to attempt it but we are keen to see the approach you take to solve it. You have the freedom to give your best into it and demonstrate your skills for us to evaluate you better. You should approach this problem as if you are building a MVP app for our production users - the process you follow and the things you should consider should reflect how you would approach this solution if you were to be working for us on something we are going to release to customers.
